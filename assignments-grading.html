                    <h4 id="participation">Class Participation</h4>

                    <p>Assignments make up the bulk of your grade in this class; additional requirements for higher grades include your performance on short quizzes, <i>and</i> your level of engagement and participation in class discussion. Participation is a somehwat subjective measure and the criteria I will use to quantify it are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Level 3: Attends all classes; frequently asks questions that demonstrate good understanding and insight into the topic.</li>
                        <li>Level 2: Attends all classes; occasionally asks questions that demonstrate (some) understanding of the topic.</li>
                        <li>Level 1: Attends some classes; seldom/never asks questions that demonstrate an understanding of the topic.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 id="specs-grading">Specifications Grading</h4>

                    <p>As in MPCS 51083, we use specifications grading in this class. You should be very familiar with this grading scheme by now, but in case you need a refresher here’s how it works:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>You select which assignments to submit. A certain minimum number of (specific) assignments are required for a passing grade; how many additional assignments you complete beyond that minimum is up to you.</li>
                        <li>Completed assignments are graded using the Satisfactory/Needs Improvement/Unsatisfactory (or SNU) scale.</li>
                        <li>Your final grade is determined by a "bundle", based on the number of Satisfactory assignments completed and your performance on quizzes as defined in the table below.</li><br /><br />

                    <p>Coming from the introductory Cloud Computing class you may be accustomed to getting very detailed (often pedantic) specifications and instructions for implementing the requirements&mdash;as well as the runtime environment. In this class I assume that you're sufficiently familiar with most of the required AWS pieces, and I expect you to do a fair amount of reading and research outside of class in order to complete the assignments. As a result the specifications are described much more tersely and the implementation approach is left largely up to you to figure out ...just like it will be in a real work environment :-).</p>

                    <p>Assignments are submitted via GitHub <a href="#submissions">as described below</a>. You also have the option to re-submit some unsatisfactory work; see <a href="#resubmissions">Resubmissions and Late Resubmissions</a> below.</p>

                    <p><i>A special request</i>: As this is the first iteration of the class it would be really helpful to me if you report the amount of time you took to complete each assignment. This will <i>in no way affect your grade or performance in the class</i>, but it will be very useful to me as I adjust/recalibrate the homework workload in future classes. Thanks in advance for helping your (future) fellow grads!</p>

                    <h4 id="submissions">Submitting Assignments</h4>

                    <p>You are required to submit all assignments in this class via GitHub. A submission link to our GitHub classroom is provided in each assignment. You must follow the link to create your repository for each assignment. The first time you do this you will be prompted to link your GitHub account to your CNetID listed in the GitHub classroom roster. You <i>must link</i> your GitHub ID to the class roster, otherwise your assignments will not be graded.</p>

                    <p>The due date and time is listed at the top of each assignment, e.g., <b>Due: Friday, May 24, 2025 at 9:00am CDT</b>.</p>

                    <p>We will treat the most recent commit timestamp displayed in GitHub as your submission time. In the case where an assignment specifies that you include a commit message (e.g., “A14 - Final Submission”), we will consider <i>the most recent commit with that message</i> as the submission time. Please make sure you understand this. <b>You will receive a “U” if there are any changes to your code or commits after the deadline&mdash;please don’t modify the repository or any other part of your code in the AWS environment after the deadline</b>.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">All commits to your repository <i><u>must be made using the GitHub account that is linked to your CNetID when you first accept an assignment in this class</u></i>. If for some reason you need to change your account during the course of the quarter, you must get approval first. Please do not commit code using any other GitHub account; doing so will result in an automatic “U” for the assignment and potentially an "F" for the class. If you notice that a commit is assocaited with a GitHub account other than yours, <i>please notify me immediately</i>.</p>

                    <h4 id="resubmissions">Resubmissions and Late Submissions</h4>

                    <p>Under our grading scheme you have the option to resubmit an assignment in order to improve your grade or request a 24-hour extension to submit an assignment late. During the quarter you may exercise these options up to <i>three times, in total</i> (for either resubmissions or late assignments).</p>

                    <h5>Resubmissions</h5>

                    <p>If you receive a “U” on an assignment you may revise and resubmit it. The following apply to resubmissions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You may only resubmit an assignment if the assignment was originally submitted on time, i.e., before the deadline specified in the assignment.</li>
                        <li>All revised work must be resubmitted <u><i>within three days of receiving the original grade on the grading branch in your GitHub repository&mdash;no exceptions/extensions</i></u>!</li>
                        <li>You may not resubmit an assignment more than once.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you decide to revise your work and resubmit, please do the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a branch named <code>&lt;assignment_number&gt;-resubmit</code>, e.g., if re-submitting Assignment 14 you must create branch <code>a14-resubmit</code>.</li>
                        <li>IMPORTANT: Post a private note on Ed informing us that you have resubmitted. If you don’t notify us via Ed we will not know that there is a resubmission for grading and, if the AWS environment is cleaned up in the interim, your efforts will have been wasted.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After reviewing your resubmission we will update the <code>grade.txt</code> file in the grading branch in GitHub.</p>

                    <h5>Late Submissions</h5>

                    <p>Late submissions will not be considered for grading but you may request a 24-hour extension. If you want to exercise this option, you must <i>notify us before the due date/time</i> by posting a private note in Ed Discussion. Any submission <i>beyond 24 hours after the due date/time</i> will not be graded. Please don’t ask for exceptions.</p>

                    <h4 id="reporting">Grade Reporting</h4>

                    <p>When your assignment is graded, we will add a “grading” branch to your repository. This branch includes a file called grade.txt that contains your grade and comments/feedback from the grader. You are expected to review the grading branch and, if you have questions/concerns about the accuracy of your grade that you would like us to review, please post a private note on Ed&mdash;DO NOT email me or the TAs directly.

                    <p><b>Make sure that you have GitHub notifications turned on so that you're notified when the grading branch is pushed to your repository. You are responsible for checking the grading branch in a timely manner if your wish to re-submit an assignment (<a href="#resubmissions">see above</a>) or otherwise have your grade reviewed.</b></p>

                    <p>The grade in your grading branch is not the final/official grade. Once the TA pushes the grading branch to remote I will review and then publish grades on Canvas (as Canvas is the only officially sanctioned system for communicating grades). There will typically be a few days lag between your grade being pushed to GitHub and my posting it on Canvas. <i>Please do not wait until Canvas grades are posted before resubmitting because it will usually be past the re-submission deadline</i>.</p>

                    <h4 id="ext-sources">Using External Sources</h4>

                    <p>I fully expect you will use external sources (such as StackOverflow) to research potential solutions and find sample code for your assignments. While you may consult and be guided by such sources, you are expected to write your own code.</p>

                    <p>In particular, you may not use AI systems, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, to write or generate any of your code. Using those systems in a manner similar to consulting online resources (e.g., asking ChatGPT something like “How do I play a sound using pygame?”) is acceptable, but you should take any answer with a healthy dose of salt, as these systems will sometimes provide unequivocally wrong answers.</p>

                    <p class="important">If you do use an AI tool, you must include a complete transcript of your interactions with the model in the README file for the assignment.</p>

                    <div class="card bg-warning">
